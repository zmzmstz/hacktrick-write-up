First of all, welcome to this challenge. 

To solve this challenge, we first do forensics by analysing the png file given to us.  

The analysis site we use: https://29a.ch/photo-forensics/#forensic-magnifier

Then, after analysing it, we realise that we have arrived at the chippi chappa alphabet, which we found in the file ‘after-forensics.png’. We also find this on the internet by osint. The next step is to understand the language of this alphabet. Then we reach the site that decodes the alphabet by searching the internet.
Our site: https://www.dcode.fr/chappe-alphabet. is.

By going to the site I mentioned, we reach the place found as a result of ‘chippi-chappa-alphabet.png’.  The inference we make from here is that we need to decode this too.

We see that it is formatted with ‘base32’ to use ‘Cyberchef’ and we reach the flag by decoding it.
