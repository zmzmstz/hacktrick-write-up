# Police Raid

In this question we are looking for a 'Karde≈üler Kebap Pide Salonu' and it is said to be in Ankara, when we searched this newly opened kebab shop on the internet and then
![alt text](kabapci.png)
we come across a kebab shop with no reviews.

We call the phone number and he asks us for the extension number.

**The conversation goes something like this:**

*-Welcome to Kardesler Kebap Pide Salonu. If you know the extension number, please dial it. If not, please wait for operator assistance.*

When we wait, the phone hangs up. However, we think of the code 1337 in the question and when we dial this as the extension number,

*-lahmacunpidedendahaiyi*

we get the answer from the other party.
Our flag is: GOP{lahmacunpidedendahaiyi}
