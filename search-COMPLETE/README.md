First of all, welcome to this challenge. 

To solve this challenge, we first do forensics by analysing the png file given to us.  

The analysis site we use: https://www.fotoforensics.com/analysis.php?id=528a3fdc5ab5cd6f563745819ca3f0adc31c289b.2710598

Then, when we analyse, we go to the location by determining the location. We analyse what is near the location. After our examination, we go to the raviour and while reading the comments, we reach the flag.

flag GOP{fl4g_f0r_manti}
