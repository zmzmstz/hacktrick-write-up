# Secret Code

We see that the speech given in this challange is a line from the Valley of the Wolves.
After searching **@KodDicle_bot** for a while and not finding anything, we realize that it might be a bot or even a telegram bot.

When we give the /start command to the bot, it asks us for the secret code.

When we research the line a little more, we find the scene and the video of the line:

After a general analysis and a long list of trials, we reach the answer by trying the agent codes that appear on the screen in the later seconds of the scene.

The bot gives us our flag and our challenge is solved.
